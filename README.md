**The Files Viewier**

The script allows you to publish the content on Internet and show it to the right people! Be aware of that, it's the completely first version of the script without any debbuging. Nevertheless everything should work properly.

**DEMO**

http://securedfiles.action2pay.pl
user: demo@demo.com
pass: demo123

**FEATURES**

- As an user you can login to access the hidden assets
- As an user you can preview the files directly on the server
- As an user you have to register a new account in order to access the hidden assets
- As an user you have to confirm the new account by the confirmation link sent by email
- Passwords are stored as md5 hash
- Files are secured against annonymous downloading
- Database not required!
- 100% responsive design
- You as an administrator can add readme.txt to the each folder so that your audience know more about the content

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**

The one reviewier of the script described it as below:

*...I have to sa that this is definitly not a real login script, it has no architecture, absolutly no security (there are so many things wrong with it, even the whole database can downloaded within one second in the final application!) and so many errors, and it's full of typing mistakes...*

Thanks for the review https://github.com/panique :-)

As you can see there is a lot to do. Any help appreciated!
